> ### To do that first open www.replit.com and sign up, then open go to this repository and click on the 'Code' button under local. Click on HTTPS and then copy the link. Open replit.com and click on 'Create Repl' button and then click on Import from GitHub. Under GitHub URL, paste the link then click on Import from GitHub. After importing open `index.html` and change the required code, logos and pictures. (Gonna make a video about how to change the required code pretty soon on my channel.

> ## Is this easy to change the title, paragraphs, code and images? I've never done programming before.
> ### Well this is easy but learning basic or intermediate HTML and some experience with programming and GitHub would be appreciated a lot. Because if you don't even know the basics of HTML, you might not be able to change the title, paragraphs, code, images etc. So I request before using this repository, learn the basics of HTML please. This is just to understand the code, thank you.
