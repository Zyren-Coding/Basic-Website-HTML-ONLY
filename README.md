# Basic-Website-HTML-ONLY
## FAQS ❓
> ## What is this website repository?
> ### This is a website model made only with HTML (No CSS/JS) I only made HTML because styling and commands should be done by your need.
---
> ## How do I change the name, title, paragraphs etc?
> ### To do that first fork the repository and then open `index.html` and change the required code. (Gonna make a video about how to change the required code pretty soon on my channel.
